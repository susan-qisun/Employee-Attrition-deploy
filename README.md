The app will help your organization predict employee attrition. The model was trained using IBM HR data. Logistics Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Bagging Ensemble models were constructed and evaluated to predict employee attrition. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to maximize model performance. The Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning is the final best model, which was then deployed with Flask on Heroku.
